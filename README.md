# Lab 6 exercises(Individual) Merge Linked Lists
## Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
- Given two linked lists, each representing a non-decreasingly sorted sequence of integers. The task is to merge these two linked lists into a single, sorted linked list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

## Output

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter values for the first linked list when prompted.
3. Enter values for the second linked list when prompted.
4. The script will reverse, merge, and print the merged linked list.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50).
- Node values are constrained to be within the range -100 to 100.

## Files

- `linked_list_merge.py`: The main Python script.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing information about the script.
